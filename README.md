# Worst GameBoy Emulator
## A pretty bad GameBoy emulator
This is just a learning project of mine. My goal isn't to create the best, most optimised emulator ever created.

My goals are:
<ol>
  <li>Create a GameBoy emulator (duh...)</li>
  <li>Make it easy to make romhacks</li>
  <li>Maybe an gb asm to c interpreter</li>
</ol>
